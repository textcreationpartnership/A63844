DVCTOR DVBITANTIVM,
OR,
The Rule of Conscience.THE FIRST BOOK. Of Conscience, the kindes of it, and 
    _ DVCTOR DVBITANTIVM,
OR,
The Rule of Conscience.

      * CHAP. I. The Rule of Conscience in general.

RULE 1. Conscience is the minde of a Man governed by a
Rule, and measured by the proportions of good
and evil, in order to practice; viz. to conduct all
our relations, and all our entercourse between
God, our Neighbours, and our Selves: that is,
in all moral actions.

RULE 2. The duty and offices of Conscience are to dictate,
and to testify or bear witness; to accuse or excuse;
to loose or binde.

RULE 3. Be careful that prejudice or passion, fancy and affection,
error or illusion, be not mistaken for Conscience.

RULE 4. The Conscience of a vicious man is an evil Judge,
and an imperfect Rule.

RULE 5. All Consciences are to walk by the same Rule,
and that which is just to one, is so to all, in the
like circumstances.

RULE 6. In Conscience that which is first is truest, easiest,
and most useful.

RULE 7. Conscience by its several habitudes and relations, or
tendencies toward its proper object, is divided
into several kindes.

      * CHAP. II. Of the Right or Sure Conscience.

RULE 1. A right Conscience is that which guides our actions
by right and proportion'd means to a right end.

RULE 2. In a right Conscience, the practical judgement, that
is, the last determination to an action, ought to be
sure and evident.

RULE 3. The practical judgement of a right Conscience is always
agreeable to the speculative determination
of the Understanding.

RULE 4. A judgement of nature, or inclination, is not sufficient
to make a sure Conscience.

RULE 5. When two motives concurre to the determination
of an action, whereof one is vertuous, and the
other secular, a Right Conscience is not prejudic'd
by that mixture.

RULE 6. An argument not sufficient nor competent, though
it doe perswade us to a thing in it self good, is
not the ground of a right, nor a sufficient warrant
for a sure Conscience.

RULE 7. A Conscience determin'd by the counsel of wise
men, even against its own inclinations, may be
sure and right.

RULE 8. He that sins against a right and a sure Conscience,
whatever the instance be, commits a great sin,
but not a double one.

RULE 9. The goodness of an object is not made by Conscience,
but is accepted, declared, and published by
it, and made personally obligatory.

      * CHAP. III. Of the Confident, or Erroneous Conscience.

RULE 1. An Erroneous Conscience commands us to doe
what we ought to omit; or to omit what we
ought to doe, or to doe it otherwise then we
should.

RULE 2. An erroneous Conscience binds us to obedience, but
not so as a right Conscience does.

RULE 3. A Conscience erring vincibly or culpably is an unavoidable
cause of sin, whether it be resisted, or
complied with.

RULE 4. It is greater sin to doe a good action against our
Conscience, then to doe an evil action in obedience
to it.

RULE 5. It is not lawful to delight in an evil action (after the
discovery of our error) which we did innocently
in an erroneous Conscience.

RULE 6. An innocent, or invincibly erring Conscience is to
be obeyed even against the known Commandement
of our Superiours.

RULE 7. The error of an abused Conscience ought to be reformed,
sometimes by the command of the will,
but ordinarily by a contrary reason.

RULE 8. The error of a Conscience is not always to be opened
to the erring person by the Guides of souls,
or any other charitable adviser.

      * CHAP. IV. Of the Probable or Thinking Conscience.

RULE 1. A probable Conscience is an imperfect assent to an
uncertain proposition, in which one part is indeed
clearly and fully chosen, but with an explicit, or
implicit notice that the contrary is also fairly eligible.

RULE 2. A Conscience that is at first, and in its own nature
probable, may be made certain by accumulation
of many probabilities operating the same perswasion.

RULE 3. Of two opinions equally probable, upon the account
of their proper reasons, one may be safer then another.

RULE. 4. An opinion that is speculatively probable, is not always
practically the same.

RULE 5. The greater probability destroys the less.

RULE 6. When two opinions seem equally probable, the last
determination is to be made by accidents, circumstances,
and collateral inducements.

RULE 7. It is not lawful to change our practical sentence
about the same object, while the same probability
remains.

RULE 8. An opinion relying upon very slender probability is
not to be followed, except in the cases of great necessity,
or great charity.

RULE 9. Multitude of Authors is not ever the most probable
inducement, nor doth it in all cases make a safe and
probable Conscience.

RULE 10. In following the authority of men, no Rule can be
antecedently given for the choice of the persons,
but the choice is wholly to be conducted by prudence,
and according to the subject matter.

RULE 11. He that hath given assent to one part of a probable
opinion, may lawfully depose that Conscience,
and that opinion upon confidence of the sentence
of another.

RULE 12. He that inquires of several Doctors until he finde
one answering according to his minde, cannot by
that inquiry make his Conscience safe; but according
to the subject matter, and other circumstances
he may.

RULE 13. He that is asked concerning a case that is on either
side probable, may answer against his own opinion,
if the contrary be probable and more safe,
or more expedient and favourable.

RULE 14. When the guide of souls is of a different opinion
from his charge or penitent, he is not bound to exact
conformity to his own opinion that is but probable,
but may proceed according to the conscience
of the penitent.

RULE 15. The sentence and arbitrement of a prudent and good
man, though it be of it self but probable, yet is
more then a probable warranty to actions otherwise
undeterminable.

      * CHAP. V. Of a doubtful Conscience.

RULE 1. A doubtful Conscience assents to neither side of the
question, and brings no direct obligation.

RULE 2. A negative doubt neither binds to action, nor inquiry,
nor repentance; but it binds onely to caution
and observance.

RULE 3. A privative doubt cannot of it self hinder a man from
acting what he is moved to by an extrinsick argument,
or inducement that is in it self prudent or
innocent.

RULE 4. In doubts of Right, or Law, we are always bound
to inquire; but in doubts of fact not always.

RULE 5. In doubts the safer part is to be chosen.

RULE 6. It is lawful for the Conscience to proceed to action
against a doubt that is meerly speculative.

RULE 7. Every dictate and judgement of the Conscience,
though it be little and less material, is sufficient
and may be made use of for the deposition of a
doubt.

RULE 8. VVhen two precepts contrary to each other meet together
about the same question, that is to be preferred
which binds most.

      * CHAP. VI. Of the Scrupulous Conscience.

RULE 1. A Scruple is a great trouble of minde proceeding
from a little motive, and a great indisposition, by
which the conscience though sufficiently determined
by proper arguments, dares not proceed to
action, or if it doe, it cannot rest.

RULE 2. A Conscience sufficiently instructed by its proper
arguments of perswasion, may without sin proceed
to action against the scruple and its weaker arguings
or stronger tremblings.

RULE 3. He that is troubled with scruples, ought to rely upon
the judgement of a prudent Guide.

RULE 4. When a doubt is resolved in the entrance of an action,
we must judge of our action afterwards by the
same measures as before; for he that changes his
measures, turns his doubt into a scruple.

RULE 5. A scrupulous Conscience is to be cured by remedies
proper to the disease, and remedies proper to the
man.

    _ OF THE
RVLE OF CONSCIENCE.
viz.
The Laws Divine and Humane,
And
All collateral Obligations.

      * CHAP. I. Of the Law of Nature in general.

RULE 1. The Law of Nature is the Universal Law of the
world, or the Law of mankinde, concerning common
necessities to which we are inclined by Nature,
invited by consent, prompted by reason, but
is bound upon us onely by the commands of
God.

RULE 2. The law of Nature is the foundation of all laws
and the measure of their obligation.

RULE 3. The first and greatest band of the law of Nature is
fear of punishment.

RULE 4. The second band of vertue is love, and its proper
and consequent deliciousness.

RULE 5. The imperfection of some provisions in civil laws are
supplied by the Natural obligation remaining upon
persons civilly incapable.

RULE 6. Sins against the laws of Nature are greater or less,
not by that proportion, but by the greatness of
the matter, and the evil consequent, or the malice
of the sinner.

RULE 7. Actions which are forbidden by the law of Nature
either for defect of power, or for the incapacity
of the matter, are not onely unlawful but
also void.

RULE 8. When an act is forbidden by the law of Nature
for the turpitude and undecency that it hath in
the matter of the Action, the act is also void
when the turpitude remains or hath a perpetual
cause.

RULE 9. The law of Nature can be dispensed with,Vide reg. 1. n. 43, 44. &c. by the
Divine power.

RULE X. The law of Nature cannot be dispensed with by any
humane power.

RULE 11. That the obligation to a Natural law does cease in
any particular, is not to be presum'd by every
one, but is to be declared by the publike voice.

RULE 12. The exactness of Natural laws is capable of interpretation,
and may be allayed by equity, and
piety, and necessity.

      * CHAP. II. Of the Law of Nature, or of all Man-kinde,
As it is commanded, digested, and perfected,
By our Supreme Lawgiver
JESVS CHRIST.
viz. Of the Christian law, the great Rule of Conscience.

RULE 1. When the law of Jesus Christ was established, the
old Testament, or the law of Moses did no longer
oblige the Conscience.

RULE 2. The Ceremonial law of Moses is wholly void.

RULE 3. The Judicial law of Moses is annul'd, or abrogated,
and retains no obliging power either in
whole or in part over any Christian Prince,
Commonwealth, or Person.

RULE 4. The ten Commandements of Moses, commonly
called the Moral law, is not a perfect digest of
the law of Nature.

RULE 5. All the explications of the Moral law which are
found in the Prophets and other holy writers of
the Old Testament, are to be accounted as parts
of the Moral law, and equally obliging the
Conscience.

RULE 6. Every thing in the Decalogue is not obligatory to
Christians, is not a portion of the Moral or Natural
law.

RULE 7. There is no state of Men or things but is to be guided
by the proportion of some Rule or precept in
the Christian law.

      * CHAP. III. Of the Interpretation and Obligation of the Laws of
JESVS CHRIST.

RULE 1. In Negative precepts the Affirmatives are commanded,
and in the Affirmative commandements
the Negatives are included.

RULE 2. When a Negative and an Affirmative seem opposite
in any sence, the Affirmative is to be
expounded by the Negative, not the Negative
by the Affirmative.

RULE 3. In the Affirmative and Negative precepts of Christ,
not onely what is in the words of the Commandement,
but whatsoever is Symbolical or alike,
is equally forbidden or commanded.

RULE 4. When any thing is forbidden, by the Laws of
Jesus Christ, all those things are forbidden also
which follow from that forbidden action, and for
whose sake it was forbidden.

RULE 5. The laws of Jesus Christ are the measures of the Spirit,
and are alwaies to be extended to a Spiritual
signification.

RULE 6. The imperate acts or outward expressions of the
Vertue of one Commandement, must not contradict
the elicite acts of another.

RULE 7. When any thing is forbidden by the Lawes of
Christ, all those things also by which we come
to that Sin are understood to be forbidden by the
same Law.

RULE 8. The suppositive propositions with the supervening
advices of our Blessed Saviour are alwaies equivalent
to matter of duty, and are by interpretation
a Commandement.

RULE 9. The institution of a Rite or Sacrament by our Blessed
Saviour is a direct law, and passes a proper
obligation in its whole integrity.

RULE 10. If the sence of a Law be dubious, we are sometimes
to expound it by Liberty, sometimes by
Restraint.

RULE 11. The positive laws of Jesus Christ cannot be dispensed
with by any humane power.

RULE 12. Not every thing that is in the Sermons and Doctrine
of Jesus Christ was intended to bind as a law or
Commandement.

RULE 13. Some things may be used in the service of God
which are not commanded in any Law, nor
explicitely commended in any doctrine of Jesus
Christ.

RULE XIV. The Christian law both of Faith and Manners is fully
contained in the Holy Scriptures; and from
thence onely can the Conscience have divine
Warrant and Authority.

RULE XV. In the Law of Christ there is no precept that
wholly ministers to the Law of Moses; but for
a time onely and less principally.

RULE XVI. The Lawes of Jesus Christ are to be interpreted to
the sense of a present obedience according to
their subject matter.

RULE XVII. Because the Lawes of Jesus Christ were delivered
in Sermons to a single person, or a definite number
of hearers, we are curiously to inquire and
wisely to understand, when those persons were
onely personally concerned, and when they were
Representatives of the whole Church.

RULE XVIII. Evangelical Lawes given to one concerning the
duty of another doe in that very relation concern
them both; but in differing degrees.

RULE XIX. Custome is no sufficient interpreter of the Lawes of
Jesus Christ.

RULE XX. The measure of perfection and obedience expected
of Christians, is greater then that of the Jews,
even in moral duties common to them and us.
